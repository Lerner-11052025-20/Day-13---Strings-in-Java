# Day-13---Strings-in-Java
📅 Day 13 - Strings in Java Welcome to Day 13 of my Data Structures &amp; Algorithms (DSA) journey. Today’s focus is on one of the most commonly used and interview-favorite topics: Strings in Java. Strings may look simple, but mastering them opens the door to solving many algorithmic problems efficiently.

📘 Key Concepts Covered:

What is a String in Java?
Immutable nature of Strings
String vs StringBuilder vs StringBuffer
Common methods in the String class (length(), charAt(), substring(), indexOf(), etc.)
Conversion between strings and character arrays
String formatting and concatenation

💻 Hands-On Implementations:

Reversing a string
Checking for palindrome
Counting vowels/consonants/digits
Removing duplicates from a string
Comparing strings (with/without case sensitivity)
String tokenization using split()

🧠 Problem Solving Practice:

Anagram Check
Longest Common Prefix
String Compression
Character Frequency Count
First Non-Repeating Character
String manipulation problems from LeetCode & GFG

⚙️ Java Tools Used:

String, StringBuilder, StringBuffer classes
Arrays.toString(), String.valueOf(), Character class utilities
StringTokenizer and split() for parsing
